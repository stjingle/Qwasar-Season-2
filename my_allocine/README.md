## Task
In this project, you will have to work with a database containing multiple tables.

## Description
The uses of SQL include modifying database table and index structures; adding, updating and deleting rows of data; and retrieving subsets of information from within a database for transaction processing and analytics applications. 
Queries and other SQL operations take the form of commands written as statements -- commonly used SQL statements include select, add, insert, update, delete, create, alter and truncate.



## Installation
Download the database:
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-claris/movies.db
